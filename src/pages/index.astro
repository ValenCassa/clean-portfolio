            Economist turned engineer. I started studying economics back in 2020
            but, 3 years after starting the degree, I realized that my passion
            was in the tech field. I learned almost all I know about programming
            by myself, and I've been working really hard to get to where I am
            today.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            I'm all about building cool stuffâ€”whether it&apos;s figuring out the
            user experience or the nuts and bolts of how a product works. When
            I'm working on a project, I'm all in, aiming to make things as great
            as they can be for the people using them.
